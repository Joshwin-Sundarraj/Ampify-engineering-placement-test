# Ampify engineering placement test JSON parser
Within this repository is my solutions to the tasks set.
## Tools used:
+ **Jupyter Notebook**: Initially I had opted to utilise the pandas libraray to display the information as a table but noticed that I was simply asked to produce a list of genres and packs.
+ **Replit IDE**: An online Integrated Development Environment that allows for one to create projects in multiple languages.
  + I also utilised this for the calculator task.
+ **Python 3.8.7**

## Instructions on running the parser (Linux)
1. In the command-line, go into the directory where the parser.py file exists.
2. Enter the command `python3 parse.py` / `python parse.py` (make sure the current version of python your using is past  3.0).
3. If the script does not run due to no permissions set in place enter the following command.
   + chmod +x parser.py

## Instructions on running the parser (windows)
1. In the command-line, go into the directory where the `parser.py` file exists.
2. You can either use powershell or cmd:
   + powershell: enter the command py `.\parser.py`.
